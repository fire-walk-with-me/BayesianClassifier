# Bayesian Classifier for predicting salaries
This is a project made as part of an AI-course in applied data science masters programme. 

I use a **bayesian classifer** in order to predict the expected salary from a data set taken from kaggle, including slaries from people in data science positions across the world.
I then use **k-means clustering** to better vizulize the data.
